    The Cyb3rhq API is an open source RESTful API that allows for interaction with the Cyb3rhq manager from a web browser, command line tool like cURL or any script or program that can make web requests. The Cyb3rhq app relies on this heavily and Cyb3rhqâ€™s goal is to accommodate complete remote management of the Cyb3rhq infrastructure via the Cyb3rhq app. Use the API to easily perform everyday actions like adding an agent, restarting the manager(s) or agent(s) or looking up syscheck details.
