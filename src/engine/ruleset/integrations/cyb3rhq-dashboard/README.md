| event.module | cyb3rhq-dashboard |Cyb3rhq dashboard module is designed to collect, parse, and analyze logs generated by [Cyb3rhq dashboard](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/cyb3rhq-dashboard/index.html), offering insights into the operation and performance of the server.
By effectively processing these logs, Cyb3rhq dashboard module serves as a powerful tool for administrators to monitor server performance, diagnose issues, and optimize operations.


## Compatibility

The integration was tested with Cyb3rhq dashboard logs from version 4.4.

## Configuration

This integration uses the logcollector source localfile to ingest the logs from `/var/log/syslog` (the location of the files can be configured in the localfile configuration).
Adding to the manager ossec.conf file the following block:

```xml
<localfile>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/syslog</location>
</localfile>
```
Note: Cyb3rhq dashboard integration depends on syslog integration. Therefore, this integration must be previously added to the engine.
